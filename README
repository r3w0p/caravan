A command-line version of the Caravan card game from Fallout: New Vegas.


===========
HOW TO PLAY
===========

BUILDING A DECK

Caravan decks consist of at least 30 cards from one of more traditional playing card sets. The deck may have any number
of cards of any type that suits a player's strategy, although it cannot have duplicate cards from the same set. For
example a K♠ from set A and a K♠ from the set B deck is acceptable, but more than one K♠ from set A would be illegal.

RULES

Caravan is played with two players building three opposing piles (or "caravans") of numbered cards. The goal is to
outbid your opponent's caravan with the highest value of numbered cards without being too light (under 21) or
overburdened (over 26).

The game begins with each player taking eight cards from their deck and placing either one numerical card or ace on each
caravan. Players may not discard during this initial round.

Once both players have started their three caravans, each player may do one of the following on their turn: 1. Play one
card and draw a new card from his or her deck to their hand: 2. Discard one card from their hand and draw a new card
from his or her deck: or 3. Discard one of their caravans by removing all cards from that pile.

Caravans have a direction, either ascending or descending numerically, and a suit. The suit is determined with the first
card placed on a caravan, the direction by the second. All subsequent cards must continue the numerical direction or
match the suit of the previous card. Cards of the same numerical value cannot be played in sequence, regardless of suit.
Face cards can be attached to numeric cards in any caravan and will affect them in various ways.

CARD VALUES

Joker - Played against Ace, 2-10. Effects change based on whether it is an ace or numbered card (see below). Multiple jokers may be played on the same card.
Ace - Value of 1. Jokers played on aces remove all other non-face cards of the ace's suit from the table. E.g. a joker played on an A♠ removes all spades (except face cards and that card, specifically) from the table.
2-10 - Listed value. Jokers played on these remove all other cards of this value from the table. E.g. a joker player on a 4♥ removes all 4s (other than that card, specifically) from the table.
Jack - Played against Ace, 2-10. Removes that card, along with any face cards attached to it.
Queen - Played against Ace, 2-10. Reverses the current direction of the hand, changes the current suit of the hand. Multiple queens may be played on the same card.
King - Played against Ace, 2-10. Adds the value of that card again. E.g. a king played on a 9 adds 9 to that hand. Multiple kings may be played on the same card for multiplicative effects. E.g. 4 + king = 8. 4 + two kings = 16.


========
CONTROLS
========

Each card in your hand has a number to the left of it, which indicates the
number you would enter if you wanted to PLAY or DISCARD it. Similarly, each
numeral card in every caravan also has a number to the left of it, which is used
to PLAY a face card onto it and indicates its position in the card stack.

The game is played by entering commands that indicate whether you want to PLAY
a card from your hand, DISCARD a card from your hand, CLEAR all cards from one
of your caravans, or EXIT the game. The commands are not case sensitive.

Pressing the Enter key will submit your command. If there is a problem with your
command, a message will appear below the game table to help you.

To PLAY a numeral card, type 'P', then the number for the card in your hand that
you want to play, then the caravan name. For example, to PLAY card 2 from your
hand onto caravan B:

[YOU] > P2B

To PLAY a face card, you must additionally specify the position of the numeral
card in the caravan you are targeting. For example, to PLAY card 4 from your
hand onto the numeral at position 3 in caravan F:

[YOU] > P4F3

To DISCARD a card, type 'D', then the number for the card in your hand that you
want to play. For example, to DISCARD card 3 from your hand:

[YOU] > D3

To CLEAR one of your caravans, type 'C', then the name of the caravan that you
want to clear. For example, to CLEAR caravan A:

[YOU] > CA

To EXIT the game, press Escape.
