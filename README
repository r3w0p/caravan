A CLI version of the Caravan card game from Fallout: New Vegas.


===========
HOW TO PLAY
===========

The game is played with two players building three opposing "caravans" (i.e. piles) of cards.
The goal is for each of your caravans to "outbid" your opponent's caravan directly opposite from it, with a bid that is neither too light (under 21) nor overburdened (over 26).
If two opposing caravans are within this range, then you must aim to get the highest bid within this range.

The cards in a caravan constitute its bid, with numeric cards (ACE, 2-10) primarily determining its bid value.
Each caravan has a suit, which is initially determined by the suit of the first numeric card placed in it.
Caravans also have a direction, ascending or descending, which is initially determined by its first two numeric cards.

All subsequent numeric cards placed in a caravan must continue in its direction if a card being placed does not have the same suit as the caravan.
TODO for example...
Numeric cards being placed with a matching suit to the caravan can be in any direction and may, therefore, change the direction of the caravan.
TODO for example...
Cards of the same numeric "rank" (i.e. value) can never be played in sequence.
For example, a 5♠ cannot be played directly onto a 5♥ because they are both of rank 5.
A caravan can have, at most, ten numeric cards in it.


Face cards (JACK, QUEEN, KING, JOKER) ...
TODO Face Cards
Face cards can be attached to Ace, 2-10 cards in any Pile by any player.
Face cards can be placed, at most, 5 times on a single card.



ACE, 2-10
Their listed value increases a caravan's bid by that amount.
ACE has a value of 1.

JACK
Removes a numeric card from a caravan, and any face cards attached to it.

QUEEN

Reverses the current direction of the caravan and changes the current suit of the caravan to the Queen's suit.
A Queen can only be played on the most recent numeric card in a caravan.

KING

adds the value of that card again.
For example: a King played on a 9 adds 9 to that hand.

Multiple kings may be played on the same card for multiplicative effects:

    4 + King = 8
    4 + two Kings = 16

JOKER

played against an Ace, removes all other Numeric cards of the Ace's suit from the table.
For example: a Joker on an A♠ removes all ♠ cards except for face cards and the A♠ it was placed on.

played against a 2-10, removes all other cards of its value from the table.
For example, a Joker player on a 4♥ removes all 4s from the table except for the 4♥ it was played on.
