A CLI version of the Caravan card game from Fallout: New Vegas.


===========
HOW TO PLAY
===========

The game is played in the same way as the original card game, with only a few
changes and restrictions, as follows.

(1) The names of the caravans have been changed to six letters, from A to F,
where caravans A, B, and C are for one player, and D, E, and F are for the
other. Caravan A competes against D, B against E, and C against F.

(2) Deck building has been simplified to create fairer games. A caravan deck
comprises between 30 and 156 cards sampled randomly from between 1 and 3
standard card decks (52 cards + 2 Jokers). The standard decks are shuffled and
may be sampled equally (a "balanced sample") or randomly.

(3) Each caravan has a limit of 10 numeral cards (i.e. ACE to 10). Each numeral
card has a limit of 5 face cards (i.e. JACK, QUEEN, KING, and JOKER) that can be
placed on it.

(4) Bidding has been removed completely.


========
CONTROLS
========

Each card in your hand has a number to the left of it, which indicates the
number you would enter if you wanted to PLAY or DISCARD it. Similarly, each
numeral card in every caravan also has a number to the left of it, which is used
to PLAY a face card onto it and indicates its position in the card stack.

The game is played by entering commands that indicate whether you want to PLAY
a card from your hand, DISCARD a card from your hand, CLEAR all cards from one
of your caravans, or EXIT the game. The commands are not case sensitive.

Pressing the Enter key will submit your command. If there is a problem with your
command, a message will appear below the game table to help you.

To PLAY a numeral card, type 'P', then the number for the card in your hand that
you want to play, then the caravan name. For example, to PLAY card 2 from your
hand onto caravan B:

[YOU] > P2B

To PLAY a face card, you must additionally specify the position of the numeral
card in the caravan you are targeting. For example, to PLAY card 4 from your
hand onto the numeral at position 3 in caravan F:

[YOU] > P4F3

To DISCARD a card, type 'D', then the number for the card in your hand that you
want to play. For example, to DISCARD card 3 from your hand:

[YOU] > D3

To CLEAR one of your caravans, type 'C', then the name of the caravan that you
want to clear. For example, to CLEAR caravan A:

[YOU] > CA

To EXIT the game, simply type:

[YOU] > EXIT
