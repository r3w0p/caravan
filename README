A CLI version of the Caravan card game from Fallout: New Vegas.


===========
HOW TO PLAY
===========

The game is played in the same way as the original card game, with only a few
changes and restrictions, as follows.

(1) The names of the caravans have been changed to six letters: A to F; where
caravan A corresponds to D, B to E, and C to F.

(2) Deck building has been simplified to create fairer games. A caravan deck
comprises between 30 and 156 cards sampled randomly from between 1 and 3
standard card decks (52 cards + 2 Jokers). The standard decks are shuffled and
may be sampled equally (a "balanced sample") or randomly.

(3) Each caravan has a limit of 10 numeral cards (i.e. ACE to 10). Each numeral
has a limit of 5 face cards (i.e. JACK, QUEEN, KING, and JOKER).
